Edited 15 times in total. /Edit Reason: new version/ )
Kodi Matrix 19.0 HDR Windows API (forked from Kodi 19 alpha master)

 
Inspired on work of @fandangos
<https://forum.kodi.tv/member.php?action=profile&uid=201031>, this fork
offers same HDR functionality (currently more) without using proprietary
Nvidia API.

Thanks to this, is compatible with Intel, Nvidia, AMD and Ryzen hardware.
 
 
KEY FEATURES
 

  * Maximum 4K image quality with passthrough of HDR10 metadata
    perfectly (independently verified with HDMI analyzer).
  * Perfect adjustment of the display refresh rate to match with
    content: 23.976 fps, 24.000 fps, etc.
  * NEW: Auto switch HDR mode and color space. Enable this feature
    from "Settings > Player > Use HDR display capabilities" = ON.
  * Toggle HDR keymap, default assigned to 'F11' key, to toggle HDR
    on/off from keyboard/remote (manual mode).
  * No need to install external programs or addons. madVR, MPC-HC, LAV
    filters, DSPlayer are not needed.
  * Play the SDR content correctly with the Windows HDR switch ON,
    although it is recommended for maximum quality to play the SDR
    content with the Windows HDR switch OFF.
  * On systems that do not have an HDR display, it playback HDR content
    using tone mapping in both DXVA and pixel shaders (HDR to SDR
    conversion).
  * Fixed important bugs in the tone mapping function present in the
    official versions of Kodi 18.5 and 19.0: very dark image or washed
    colors.
  * It supports the HLG (Hybrid Log-Gamma) format used for HDR in Live
    TV broadcasts. Compatible with the "IPTV PVR Simple client" addon
    but in the future more addons can be created / updated supporting it.
  * All HDR functionality has been implemented using only the standard
    Microsoft Windows API. It does not use pre-compiled external
    libraries or proprietary APIs from Intel or Nvidia. It does not use
    hacks that only work for a specific type of HW, therefore, it is
    highly compatible with most Intel, Nvidia, AMD or Ryzen HDMI 2.0
    graphics cards.
  * Improved swapchain performance using some new DX12 / Windows 10
    features.
  * Fixed NVIDIA only related stuttering/tearing issues. These are also
    common for 1080p SDR content but it's less obvious (still present in
    18.5 / 19 master and can affect some users).


Tested on Intel NUC 8i3BEK + Denon AVX-1600H + Sony TV KD-55AG9 OLED.

and

Asus Maximus XI Hero + Nvidia GTX1650 +  Denon AVX-1600H + Sony TV
KD-55AG9 OLED

Also works on AMD and Ryzen hardware.

Test results on other hardware are welcomed. Smile

This is freaking cool Smile)

You can use the DisplayConfig exe from my fork with this and have
automatic hdr.

I'll test this soon.

Edit: Would you mind if I use part of your code to fix intel on my fork?

I haven't added it yet because it causes instability.

It seems that Microsoft does not want to switch from outside...

However, the SDR material is displayed well with the switch ON (but it
is not ideal).

Of course you can use it. But the goal is to be integrated all into the
master branch.

Yes, I'm aware of that and I think this is the way to go forward, in my
opinion. 

Still, we need to figure out a way to switch HDR on and OFF. Watching a
SDR content if nothing is over 100nits it's a waste of eletrict power
and causes the LEDs on TVs to die quicker. 
Also, it would be a great addition if someone with a HDFury or some sort
of capture device that can handles HDR could experiment both methods,
private APIs and Windows API and check if the metadata is passed
correctly now. 

I've seen people debating about this and Madshi also mentioned the
metadata problem with me. So if microsoft fixed it we are one step
closer for a true Windows solution.

About the switching, the DisplayConfig source code is on my Git, maybe
it won't crash if used within Kodi with your code.

And I have to ask, you seem to be a way better coder than I am, would
you be willing to take a look at libbluray? Smile
I've tried but I can't fix it.

Tested your fork with Nvidia hardware.  (in case it's not clear it
works!) Smile)

Now I understand the switch, you need to turn it on, but while not
playing HDR content Kodi will remain SDR and HDR will be disabled. 
It's way better than I had imagined. 

Also it might be a good idea to toggle tone mapping OFF if HDR is detected. 
I have it off by default on my Git but the code location and what needs
to be changed are there. 

Also in VideoDatabase you can see that tone mapping will be set ON again
in case the user changes anything like subtitles, audio languages etc. 
So this needs to be addressed too. 
I have disabled it on my git, in case you want to look into this.

I have no way of knowing if the metadata is passed in a strictly correct
way but comparing the image with of the internal TV player (Android TV)
is identical. For me now is OK.

In any case, this is far better than nothing (in the master branch). 

Logically, can always be improved from this starting point.

Your solution works well on NVIDIA hw however it cannot be included as
it is in the master branch.

There's always DSPlayer in serious need of some love. Maybe you two
could work on it together, once HDR is implemented in Windows?

This is halted for now on my end. I'm dedicating a good time to my
family since I'm finally at home now. 

Still, Jogal seems like a WAY better coder than I'm. I have placed 80%
of DSplayer code by hand on the correct places. 
I would enjoy working on this while learning from someone else that
knows more than me.

Yeah, if you two could work together it would be fantastic. Also, it's
worth mentioning, Team Kodi is looking for Windows developers for the
main release.

Hello.

Dunno if this is the right place to post my testing. But here goes,
nonetheless.

I have tested it on my Omen laptop.
Intel i7-8750 with 16gb Ram
Nvidia 1060.

All drivers and windows software are up to date.

The TV (Samsung with HDR) now sucessfully detects HDR as soon as i
launch Kodi. So this is a BIG improvement for me.
but
Video playback is very bad with constant shuttering.

Also, after returning from video playback, the color of the images
(covers) from movies seem oversaturated.

Tested it with 3 different 4kHDR video files.

Update:

After installing HEVC from the windows store:
https://go.skimresources.com/?id=19619X7...52d4fc98aa
<https://go.skimresources.com/?id=19619X769413&isjs=1&jv=13.25.1-stackpath&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fforum.videohelp.com%2Fthreads%2F394116-New-PC-pls-recommend-me-a-media-player-etc-to-test-4k-hdr-playback&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fhevc-video-extensions-from-device-manufacturer%2F9n4wgh0z6vhq%23activetab%3Dpivot%3Aeek%3Averviewtab&xguid=1c22fa9081fe54172189522206dca12f&xs=1&xtz=0&xuuid=b8080c97a437d4cbc2137652d4fc98aa>

I can now play all the files without any problem, with the TV correctly
reporting HDR.

(i do have to turn it "on" the TV though as opposed to using PS4 and the
TV turning it on automatically).
